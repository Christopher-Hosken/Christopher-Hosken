I'm a 17 year old student on my way to becoming a Technical Artist. I've been programming for 3 years and am profficient in HTML, CSS, Python, and Java. Alongside programming, I've been doing digital art for 6 years. I'm extremely experienced in Blender and am currently learning Houdini, Nuke, and Maya.
